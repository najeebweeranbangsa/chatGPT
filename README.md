3. **Add OpenAI API Key:** In order to use the app, you need an OpenAI API key. You should have received this key when you signed up for the OpenAI API. Add your API key to the app's configuration. Locate the configuration file (e.g., `config.js` or similar) and insert your API key:

   };

   export default config;
   ```

4. **Run the App:** You can now run the app on a simulator or device using the following command:
